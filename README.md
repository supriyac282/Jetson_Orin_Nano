# Multi Camera 


This project integrates the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with two ZED 2i cameras, employing PyTorch and YOLOv8 for real-time object detection. The combination enables efficient processing of stereo images, making it suitable for edge applications such as autonomous navigation and surveillance, where rapid and accurate analysis of visual data is essential.
